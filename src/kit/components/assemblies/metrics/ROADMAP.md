# Metrics family — roadmap

**Scope of this file:** family inventory, shared config, sequencing across units,
and cross-cutting conventions. Unit-specific phases live in each unit’s
`ROADMAP.md` — do not duplicate them here.

**Status:** scaffolding. No metrics unit implementation until that unit’s roadmap
is agreed and its README exists.

---

## Why this family exists

`assemblies/metrics/` holds **visual metrics surfaces** — steppers, summary cards,
charts, graphs. Product pages configure them; they do not own Beacon/Lens fetch or
domain catalogs.

**Non-destructive:** first product wiring **replaces** call sites (e.g. Beacon
`PipelineView`) by swapping in kit units. Existing domain components stay until
each replace lands. Nothing is deleted in this scaffolding pass.

## Inventory

| Unit | Export | Job | Unit roadmap |
| ---- | ------ | --- | ------------ |
| Stepper | `LwMetricsStepper` | Hydratable progress metrics (PF ProgressStepper host) | [`stepper/ROADMAP.md`](./stepper/ROADMAP.md) |
| Count | `LwMetricsCount` | One metric cell (PF text + status bar) | [`count/ROADMAP.md`](./count/ROADMAP.md) |
| Card | `LwMetricsCard` | `LwCard` + composable `items` / children | [`card/ROADMAP.md`](./card/ROADMAP.md) |
| Stat item | `LwStatItem` | Compact value + label (no PF host); prefer Count when bar/tooltip needed | [`stat-item/README.md`](./stat-item/README.md) |
| Donut chart | `LwMetricsDonutChart` | Donut / utilization metrics | [`donut/ROADMAP.md`](./donut/ROADMAP.md) |
| Stack chart | `LwMetricsStackChart` | Stacked bar / area metrics | [`stack/ROADMAP.md`](./stack/ROADMAP.md) |

Add a unit row here when a unit folder + roadmap + README are created. Do **not**
put step APIs, animation details, or chart series props in this file.

## Shared config (family-owned)

| Concern | Home | Notes |
| ------- | ---- | ----- |
| Match-status chromatic tokens | `lightwell.config.ts` + `lightwell.config.css` | Absorbed from Lens `chartTheme` (`exact` / `partial` / `none`). CSS vars are source of paint; TS exposes the same keys. |
| Domain → token maps | Per unit or later `metrics.config` | Open: passthrough vs map. Decide per unit when implementing — family only requires tokens exist at root. |
| Presentational family tokens | `metrics.config.css` (when needed) | Spacers / type shared by ≥2 metrics units. Not YAML. |

**Cascade reminder:** tenant chromatic → family/unit presentational CSS → unit
co-located CSS. Prop defaults stay in `components.config.ts` when a unit needs them.

---

## Chart convention (all chart units)

Every chart assembly uses PatternFly **Resize Observer** for responsive sizing /
wrapping legends:

https://www.patternfly.org/components/charts/resize-observer#responsive-bullet-chart-with-wrapping-legend

Unit roadmaps for Donut / Stack own series APIs and PF chart host choice; they
must cite this convention and not redefine it.

## Sequencing (family)

| Order | Work | Owner doc |
| ----- | ---- | --------- |
| F0 | Family scaffolding (this file), root match-status colors, skill rule | this file |
| F1 | Page-hero multi chrome-slot rows (build/validate surface; not Beacon coupling) | page family + this file |
| F2 | `LwMetricsStepper` implementation | [`stepper/ROADMAP.md`](./stepper/ROADMAP.md) |
| F3 | Beacon replace: `PipelineView` → `LwMetricsStepper` (totals stay; card later) | product + stepper README |
| F4 | `LwMetricsCount` + `LwMetricsCard`; Beacon Status Summary + Lens `MatchSummaryStats` | count/card roadmaps |
| F5 | Chart units + Lens `chartTheme` consumers read root colors | donut/stack roadmaps |
| F5a | Lens coverage layout extract — snapshot, page compose, restore domain blocks | [`examples/lens-coverage-layout-extract.md`](./examples/lens-coverage-layout-extract.md) |
| F6 | Further product replaces as needed | product |

F3+ are **replace** operations at call sites — additive kit, swap imports/JSX.

**Lens coverage (F5a):** preserve the current hero layout by extracting donut/stack
**jobs** into kit, composing pieces on `CoverageReport`, then restoring mutated
`Lens/components` metrics blocks. Do not promote `CoverageSummaryBlock` /
`EcosystemBreakdownBlock` wholesale. Details + layout snapshot:
[`examples/lens-coverage-layout-extract.md`](./examples/lens-coverage-layout-extract.md).

## Explicitly out of family roadmap

- Step unhydrated/hydrated behavior, tooltips, CSS animation — **stepper** roadmap
- Totals/Critical card layout — **card** roadmap
- Donut/stack series, legends, PF chart props — **chart** roadmaps
- Where Beacon mounts the stepper in the hero — product; kit stays plug-and-play

---

## Validation (family)

| Gate | When |
| ---- | ---- |
| Root match-status tokens compile / Lens can import them | F0 |
| `LwPageHeader hero` hosts ≥2 `.lw-c-page-header-chrome-slots` rows via composition | F1 |
| Each unit: README + roadmap before `.tsx` | every unit |
| Smoke: build/validate surface via page-header hero chrome row (not required to be Beacon) | F2+ |
