# LwMetricsCard — roadmap

**Scope:** this unit only — `LwCard` shell, body passthrough.
**Not here:** `LwMetricsCount`, family inventory, stepper.
Link: [`../count/ROADMAP.md`](../count/ROADMAP.md), [`../ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md).

## Job

Generic metrics card: `LwCard` + composable body (`children` / `items`).
Configured once; call sites pass `LwMetricsCount` nodes. Count-row layout lives
in unit CSS — no call-site Flex.

| Priority | Condition | Behavior |
| -------- | --------- | -------- |
| 1 | `children` | Body content |
| 2 | `items` | Body content |
| 3 | neither | Empty body |

## Phases

| Phase | Deliverable | Done when |
| ----- | ----------- | --------- |
| M0 | README + roadmap | Consensus |
| M1 | Shell + body passthrough | Unit tests |
| M2 | Barrel; Beacon + Lens call sites | Wired |

**Progress:** M0–M2 — body is content; layout stays at the call site.
